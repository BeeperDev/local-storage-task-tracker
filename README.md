## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, EJS, Local Storage

This app takes in client input and stores the ticket form input data to local storage in the browser to track helpdesk tickets. Once tickets are given a unique ID they are listed below the form to be worked on. Helpdesk managers can close and reopen specific tickets as they are worked on.

## Optimizations

Enhance this app by using a database to store the form data instead of local storage. Utilize MVC structure for organization and maintenance.

## Lessons Learned:

Local storage is super useful because you can always pick up where you left off on your project even when the window or tab is closed. Client data is stored locally in the browser and can only be deleted manually.
